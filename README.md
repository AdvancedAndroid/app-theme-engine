# App Theme Engine (BETA)

App Theme Engine is a library that makes it easy for developers to implement a theme system in 
their apps, similar to what's seen in [Cabinet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.cabinet) 
and [Impression](https://github.com/afollestad/impression).

Download the [latest sample APK](https://github.com/afollestad/app-theme-engine/raw/master/sample/Sample.apk) to check it out! 

![Showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/app-theme-engine/master/art/showcase.png)

# When To NOT Use This Library

If your app has two themes, a light theme and a dark theme, do not use this library to configure them. 
Only use this library if you intend to give the user the ability to change the color of UI elements in your app.ï»¿

# Config

By default, Android app themes are static. They cannot be changed dynamically after an APK is built. This 
library allows you to dynamically change theme colors at runtime.

All configuration options are persisted using SharedPreferences, meaning once you set them, you don't have 
to set them again unless you want the value to be changed from what it was previously.

#### Modifiers

Here are a few configuration methods that can be used:

```java
// 0 to disable, sets a default theme for all Activities which use this config key
ATE.config(this, null) 
    // 0 to disable, sets a default theme for all Activities which use this config key
    .activityTheme(R.style.my_theme) 
    .coloredActionBar(true)
    .primaryColor(color)
    // when true, primaryColorDark is auto generated from primaryColor
    .autoGeneratePrimaryDark(true) 
    .primaryColorDark(color)
    .accentColor(color)
    .coloredStatusBar(true)
    // by default, is equal to primaryColorDark unless coloredStatusBar is false
    .statusBarColor(color)
     // dark status bar icons on Marshmallow (API 23)+
    .lightStatusBarMode(Config.LIGHT_STATUS_BAR_AUTO)
    .coloredNavigationBar(false)
    // by default, is equal to primaryColor unless coloredNavigationBar is false
    .navigationBarColor(color)
    .textColorPrimary(color)
    .textColorPrimaryInverse(color)
    .textColorSecondary(color)
    .textColorSecondaryInverse(color)
    // enables or disables the next 4 values
    .navigationViewThemed(true) 
    .navigationViewSelectedIcon(color)
    .navigationViewSelectedText(color)
    .navigationViewNormalIcon(color)
    .navigationViewNormalText(color)
    // activity, fragment, or view
    .apply(this);
```

There's also color resource and color attribute variations of the color modifiers. For an example: 
rather than using `primaryColor(int)`, you could use `primaryColorRes(int)` or `primaryColorAttr(int)` 
in order to pass a value in the format `R.color.resourceValue` or `R.attr.attributeValue`.

#### Keys

The second parameter of `ATE.config(Context, String)` was null above, because it's optional. You can instead 
pass a String of any value as a key. This will allow you to keep separate configurations, which can be applied 
to different Activities, Fragments, Views, at will. Passing null specifies to use the default. You could have 
two Activities which store their own separate theme values independently, or you could have two configurations 
for a light and dark theme.

The [Applying](https://github.com/afollestad/app-theme-engine#applying) section will go over this a bit more.

#### Default Configuration

If you want to setup a default configuration the first time your app is run, you can use code like this:

```java
if (!ATE.config(this, null).isConfigured()) {
    // Setup default options for the default (null) key
}
```

Again, the second parameter is an optional key.

#### Value Retrieval

Using the `Config` class, you can retrieve your theme values (if you need to for any reason). For an example:

```java
int primaryColor = Config.primaryColor(this, null);
```

And yet again, the second parameter is an optional key.

#### Customizers

Customizers are interfaces your Activities can implement to specify theme values without saving them 
in your Configuration (if you don't want to use separate keys for different screens).

```java
public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity 
        implements ATEActivityThemeCustomizer, ATEStatusBarCustomizer, ATETaskDescriptionCustomizer, ATENavigationBarCustomizer {
    
    @StyleRes
    @Override
    public int getActivityTheme() {
        // Self explanatory. Can be used to override activityTheme() config value if set.
        return R.style.my_activity_theme;
    }
    
    @ColorInt
    @Override
    public int getStatusBarColor() {
        // Normally the status bar is a darker version of the primary theme color
        return Color.RED;
    }
    
    @ColorInt
    @Override
    public int getTaskDescriptionColor() {
        // Task description is the color of your Activity's entry in Android's recents screen
        return Color.BLUE;
    }
    
    @ColorInt
    @Override
    public int getNavigationBarColor() {
        // Navigation bar is usually either black, or equal to the primary theme colro
        return Color.GREEN;
    }
}
```

You can override some or all, to fit your needs. But again, you don't *need* to use these if you use keys for 
different configurations.

#### Marking as Changed

In the sample project, you can switch between a light and dark theme. The preference that says whether or 
not the dark theme is active is not part of ATE. The sample project tells MainActivity that it
needs to restart on return from the Settings Screen when the dark theme has been toggled.

```java
// Second parameter is an optional Config key
Config.markChanged(this, null);
```

This method tells all already running Activities that the configuration has been changed since they were 
first opened, without having to edit other configuration values.

You can mark multiple configuration keys as changed:

```java
Config.markChanged(this, "light_theme", "dark_theme");
```

---

# Applying

Once you have configurations set, you can apply the theme engine to Activities, Fragments, and even 
individual views.

#### ATEActivity

As seen in the sample project, you can have all Activities in your app extends `ATEActivity`. This will do
all the heavy lifting for you.

```java
public class MyActivity extends ATEActivity {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.my_layout);
    }
}
```

If you were to leave the Activity, change theme values (e.g. in a Settings screen), and come back,
the Activity would automatically recreate itself.

You can also change theme values in real time within the Activity using the `ATE.apply()` or `Config#apply()` methods.

---

The [Config](https://github.com/afollestad/app-theme-engine#config) section emphasized the fact that you can
use keys to separate different theme configurations. `ATEActivity` has an optional override method called 
`getATEKey()` which can be used to specify a configuration to use in individual activities.

```java
public class MyActivity extends ATEActivity {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.my_layout);
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    protected String getATEKey() {
        return getClass().getName();
    }
}
```

The value returned here is used in many other areas too. For an example, there are two versions of almost every method. 
One that accepts a config key, one that doesn't. `ATE.config(Context, String)` is a good example. If you were to use 
 `ATE.config(Context)` and pass the above `Activity` as the `Context`, it would automatically use the return value 
 of `getATEKey()` as the second parameter even though it wasn't directly specified.

#### Custom Activities and Fragments

If you don't use `ATEActivity`, there's a few things you have to do:

```java
public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private long updateTime = -1;

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // Apply theming to status bar, nav bar, and task description (recents).
        // Second parameter is optional config key.
        ATE.preApply(this, null);
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        
        // Always call BEFORE apply()
        setContentView(R.layout.my_layout);
        
        // Store the time the engine was initially applied, so the Activity can restart when coming back after changes
        updateTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        // Apply colors to other views in the Activity. Call after all initial view setup, including toolbars!
        // Second parameter is optional config key.
        ATE.apply(this, null);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        // If values were applied/committed (from Config) since the Activity was created, recreate it now
        // Third parameter is optional config key.
        if (ATE.didValuesChange(this, updateTime, null))
            recreate();
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.my_menu, menu);
        ATE.applyMenu(this, getATEKey(), menu);
        return super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onMenuOpened(int featureId, Menu menu) {
        ATE.applyOverflow(this, getATEKey());
        return super.onMenuOpened(featureId, menu);
    }
}
```

---

You can also apply theming to views in a Fragment:

```java
public class MyFragment extends Fragment {

    ...

    @Override
    public void onViewCreated(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);
        ATE.apply(this, null);
    }
}
```

---

And again, replace occurrences of `null` above with a key if you need separate configurations.

#### Toolbars, Menus, and Overflows

ATE will automatically theme your toolbars or support action bars.

*If the toolbar background is light*: the navigation icon (e.g. home up or drawer icon) will be tinted black,
the title text color will be black, the menu icons will be tinted black, and the overflow button will be tinted black.

*If the toolbar background is dark*: the navigation icon (e.g. home up or drawer icon) will be tinted white,
the title text color will be white, the menu icons will be tinted white, and the overflow button will be tinted white. 

---

ATE will also automatically theme widgets in your overflow menu, such as checkboxes and radio buttons.

#### Lists and Individual Views

You theme individual views like this:

```java
ATE.apply(view, null);
```

The second parameter is an optional Config key.

---

When working with lists, you have to apply the theme engine to each individual view in your adapter.

For *RecyclerViews*:

```java
public static class MyAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.MyViewHolder> {

    public MyAdapter() {
    }

    @Override
    public MyViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        View list = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())
                .inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false);
        return new MyViewHolder(list);
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(MyViewHolder holder, int position) {
        // Setup views
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return 20;
    }

    public static class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {

        public MyViewHolder(View itemView) {
            super(itemView);
            // It's recommended you only apply the theme the first time the holder is created.
            // Second parameter is optional key.
            ATE.apply(itemView, null);
        }
    }
}
```

For *ListViews*:

```java
public static class MyAdapter extends BaseAdapter {

    @Override
    public int getCount() {
        return 20;
    }

    @Override
    public Object getItem(int position) {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public long getItemId(int position) {
        return position;
    }

    @Override
    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
        if (convertView == null) {
            convertView = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())
                    .inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false);
            // Only apply the first time the view is created.
            // Second parameter is optional key.
            ATE.apply(convertView, null);
        }
        return convertView;
    }
}
```

#### Navigation Drawers

ATE will automatically adapt when your Activity has a `DrawerLayout` at its root. When `coloredStatusBar()` 
is set to true, the primary dark theme color will be applied to the `DrawerLayout` rather than directly to 
the Window status bar. Thus, the status bar will be transparent when the drawer is open, and your theme
color when it's closed. You don't have to manually do anything.

If you use `NavigationView` from the design support library, ATE will by default theme it. There are 
navigation view theming configuration methods discussed in the next section. If your drawer uses a `Fragment`
or plain `ListView`/`RecyclerView`, you have to do what's discussed in the previous section.

#### Task Description (Recents)

You don't have to do anything extra for this. Your app's Android recents (multi-tasking) entry will 
be themed to your primary color automatically.

There is however an `ATETaskDescriptionCustomizer` that's discussed in the [Customizers](https://github.com/afollestad/app-theme-engine#customizers)
 section.

---

# Tags

If you haven't used tags before, they can be applied to views directly from your XML layouts:

```xml
<View
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:tag="tag-value-here" />
```

The theme engine allows you to apply theme colors to any view using tags. **You can even use multiple tags, separated by commas**:

```xml
<View
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:tag="tag-one,tag-two,tag-three" />
```

Here's a list of available tag values:

#### Background Colors

You can change the background of any type of view.

1. `bg_primary_color` - sets the background to the primary color.
2. `bg_primary_color_dark` - sets the background to the primary dark color.
3. `bg_accent_color` - sets the background to the accent color.
4. `bg_text_primary` - sets the background to the primary text color.
5. `bg_text_primary_inverse` - sets the background to the inverse primary text color.
6. `bg_text_secondary` - sets the background to the secondary text color.
7. `bg_text_secondary_inverse` - sets the background to the inverse secondary text color.

#### Text Colors

You can only change the text color of a view that extends `TextView`, which includes `Button`'s.

1. `text_primary_color` - sets the text color to the primary color.
2. `text_primary_color_dark` - sets the text color to the primary dark color.
3. `text_accent_color` - sets the text color to the accent color.
4. `text_primary` - sets the text color to the primary text color.
5. `text_primary_inverse` - sets the text color to the inverse primary text color.
6. `text_secondary` - sets the text color to the secondary text color.
7. `text_secondary_inverse` - sets the text color to the inverse secondary text color.

#### Text Link Colors

This should only really be needed on `TextView'`s, it changes the color of links when TextViews are linkable.

1. `text_link_primary_color` - sets the link text color to the primary color.
2. `text_link_primary_color_dark` - sets the link text color to the primary dark color.
3. `text_link_accent_color` - sets the link text color to the accent color.
4. `text_link_primary` - sets the link text color to the primary text color.
5. `text_link_primary_inverse` - sets the link text color to the inverse primary text color.
6. `text_link_secondary` - sets the link text color to the secondary text color.
7. `text_link_secondary_inverse` - sets the link text color to the inverse secondary text color.

#### Text Shadow Colors

This can be used on `TextView'`s, it changes the `shadowColor` value.

1. `text_shadow_primary_color` - sets the link text color to the primary color.
2. `text_shadow_primary_color_dark` - sets the link text color to the primary dark color.
3. `text_shadow_accent_color` - sets the link text color to the accent color.
4. `text_shadow_primary` - sets the link text color to the primary text color.
5. `text_shadow_primary_inverse` - sets the link text color to the inverse primary text color.
6. `text_shadow_secondary` - sets the link text color to the secondary text color.
7. `text_shadow_secondary_inverse` - sets the link text color to the inverse secondary text color.

#### Tint Colors

You can tint `CheckBox`'s, `RadioButton`'s, `ProgressBar`'s, `EditText`'s, `SeekBar`'s, and `ImageView`'s. 

1. `tint_primary_color` - tints the view with the primary color.
2. `tint_primary_color_dark` - tints the view with the primary dark color.
3. `tint_accent_color` - tints the view with the accent color.
4. `tint_text_primary` - tints the view with the primary text color.
5. `tint_text_primary_inverse` - tints the view with the inverse primary text color.
6. `tint_text_secondary` - tints the view with the secondary text color.
7. `tint_text_secondary_inverse` - tints the view with the inverse secondary text color.

---

Background tints work on any type of view:

1. `bg_tint_primary_color` - tints the view background with the primary color.
2. `bg_tint_primary_color_dark` - tints the view background with the primary dark color.
3. `bg_tint_accent_color` - tints the view background with the accent color.
4. `bg_tint_text_primary` - tints the view background with the primary text color.
5. `bg_tint_text_primary_inverse` - tints the view background with the inverse primary text color.
6. `bg_tint_text_secondary` - tints the view background with the secondary text color.
7. `bg_tint_text_secondary_inverse` - tints the view background with the inverse secondary text color.

---

You can even use background tint selectors:

1. `bg_tint_primary_color_selector_lighter` - tints the view background with a primary color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
2. `bg_tint_primary_color_dark_selector_lighter` - tints the view background with a primary dark color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
3. `bg_tint_accent_color_selector_lighter` - tints the view background with a accent color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
4. `bg_tint_text_primary_selector_lighter` - tints the view background with a primary text color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
5. `bg_tint_text_secondary_selector_lighter` - tints the view background with a secondary text color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
6. `bg_tint_primary_color_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a primary color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
6. `bg_tint_primary_color_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a primary color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
7. `bg_tint_primary_color_dark_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a primary dark color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
8. `bg_tint_accent_color_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a accent color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
9. `bg_tint_text_primary_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a primary text color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
10. `bg_tint_text_primary_inverse_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a inverse primary text color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
11. `bg_tint_text_secondary_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a secondary text color selector, which is lighter when pressed.
12. `bg_tint_text_secondary_inverse_selector_darker` - tints the view background with a inverse secondary text color selector, which is lighter when pressed.

---

# Pre-made Views

Seven views come stock with this library:

1. `ATECheckBox` - tints itself to the accent color.
2. `ATERadioButton` - tints itself to the accent color.
3. `ATEEditText` - tints itself to the accent color
4. `ATEProgressBar` - tints itself to the accent color.
5. `ATESeekBar` - tints itself to the accent color.
6. `ATEPrimaryTextView` - sets its text color to the primary text color.
7. `ATESecondaryTextView` - sets its text color to the secondary text color.

All that they really do is set their own tag to one of the tag values in the previous section,
and then apply theming to themselves using the individual view `apply()` method.

---

If you use Config keys in your app, you may want to apply theme to these pre-made views:

```xml
<com.afollestad.appthemeengine.ATECheckBox
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:ateKey_checkBox="your-config-key-here" />
```

All of the different views have a different suffix to `app:ateKey_`, since using the same attribute 
name for all of them would result in duplicate errors.

You can even use theme attributes in your Activity themes and reference them for this value (which is 
done in the sample project since different keys are used for a light and dark theme).
